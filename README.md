## Description:

A modified Tic Tac Toe game where each player only has 3 pieces to play. Once all of them are on the board, they must take turns replacing one piece each until either player wins. It has two-player support, and a simple AI for single-player play. You can navigate through the screens linearly, and through the game view you can either reset the game or go back to the start ("home" button only shows up on victory but it's still there throughout the game)
